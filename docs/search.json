    "text": "Sometimes I feel like pursuing depth. Scribbling through a difficult problem. Other times it’s about breadth. Searching for existing solutions to my problem. Sometimes it’s about people. Connecting with others, seeing what they’re working on, what they’re thinking about, and how we might help each other. Sometimes it’s about planning, or otherwise separating coulds from shoulds.\nAll of these require a different hat, a different set of skills and tools, and there’s a cost to switching. But more subtle than that, there’s a cost to wearing the wrong hat at the wrong time. I understand that it’s unrealistic to expect absolute freedom here. In fact, I’m not sure that’s ideal. Too much freedom is itself a source of pressure. A vacuum. But somewhere in the middle, where there’s just enough pressure to push you forward, together with just enough room to wear the right hat, there’s a sweet spot.\nYou might be wondering how anything would get done if we decided what work to do on a whim. I think this is one of the defining factors of a great team. A team with diversity in strengths, weaknesses, backgrounds, and more generally, modes of thought, is like a polyphase system. It provides constant power transfer, despite its individual conductors peaking at different points in time, ultimately delivering more power than single-phase systems for the same voltage."

It’s perfectly fine to use clever techniques and definitions, such as rleDecode = (uncurry replicate =&lt;&lt;) for decoding run-length encoded lists of tuples, but in the comments, include the original giant definition which you progressively refined into a short diamond! Even better, add a test (like a QuickCheck property) where you demonstrate that the output from the two are the same. If you are optimizing, somewhere hold onto the slow ones which you know are correct. Derivations are brilliant documentation of your intent, they provide numerous alternate implementations which might work if the current one breaks, and they give the future Haskellers a view of how you were thinking.\n— Gwern, Resilient Haskell Software\nInclude derivations!

I’ve heard it and even given it many times.\nThe argument goes something like this: comments tend to become out of sync with the code they’re commenting. While your code is tested by its users and by your test suite, there’s nothing to ensure that comments remain correct.1 It seems natural then that without any sticking force your comments become outdated.\nYet I still find myself smiling when I come across well-commented code. Why the discrepency?"

    "text": "Developer- vs user-oriented comments\nAny given program has at least two groups of people interacting with it: developers, who directly change and extend the underlying functionality; and users, who use that functionality.\nDevelopers and users benefit from different forms of documentation. Users typically don’t need to know the full extent of implementation details and the context in which decisions were made, instead they need to know the interface of the various components, how those components interact, and how to compose them to achieve a desired goal. Developers, on the other hand, need to know the implementation details in all their glory.\nFor example, while users probably don’t need to know why a specific method was chosen to decode run-length encoded lists of tuples, this is absolutely the type of information a developer needs to make good decisions about how to further extend that functionality. In the same way users probably don’t need to know why the specific method was chosen, developers probably don’t need the function’s arguments redescribed to them each time. Self-documenting functions and argument names do just fine. I increasingly see inline comments and docstrings for the purpose of auto-generating user docs as redundant noise while working with the code. Perhaps a topic for a future post. Naturally, comments describing those arguments gradually fade away from our attention, and are left outdated.\nI view developer-oriented comments as distinctly different from user-oriented comments. Someone from the past is talking directly to me: warning me of a trap, describing a hard-to-find workaround, or lamenting why this “temporary hack” should be temporary. These feel like an extension of the code, thus I consider them less susceptible to becoming outdated."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I attended JupyterCon 2023 in Paris two weeks ago. On Thursday, Hamel Husain, myself, and J. J. Allaire (as a teaching assistant) presented a two and a half hour tutorial on Writing, Documenting, Testing, and Distributing Python Packages with nbdev and Quarto.\nI think it went well! The room was full and attendees engaged with great questions.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the tutorial website taken with shot-scraper.\n\n\nHamel opened by describing the roots of nbdev’s programming paradigm: a combination of literate programming (introduced by Donald Knuth) and exploratory programming (beautifully demonstrated by Bret Victor) made possible by Jupyter notebooks. He then took us through both basic and advanced usage of Quarto – the publishing platform that powers nbdev’s documentation generation.\nI followed with a demonstration of my approach to notebook-driven development by live coding the now classic nbdev example: a library for interacting with playing cards based on Chapter 18 of Allen B. Downey’s Think Python. I tried to focus on the thinking process and how it differs from more conventional programming paradigms, rather than focusing on the mechanics of how nbdev works since that is so readily available online.\nMy demonstration was largely based on the official written nbdev tutorial and best practices post. I also used the tutorial as an opportunity to refine these docs. The biggest refinement was that I now recommend JupyterLab instead of the classic notebook. There are two main reasons for this:\n\nLab has a growing extension ecosystem:\n\nI can’t live without the wonderful jupyterlab-quarto. It renders Quarto markdown including frontmatter, callouts, and fenced divs which greatly improves the authoring experience.\nThere is interesting work being done on LLM-related extensions like jupyter-ai which adds an LLM chat interface to the sidebar.\n\nLab 4.0.0 was released! It comes with significantly better performance among a ton of other improvements. Most notably for me is a built-in implementation of classic’s collapsible headings extension (including the keyboard shortcuts). However, it is worth noting that extensions will need to migrate to version 4 and I’m keen to see what this process will look like!\n\nYou can also find an outline of the tutorial as well as the slides for Hamel’s opening section at the tutorial website: https://fastai.github.io/jupytercon-2023.\nBy the way, we wrote the tutorial site using Quarto too! Here is the underlying repo: https://github.com/fastai/jupytercon-2023.\nThe conference venue was beautiful! On the last day, David Brochart, Hamel Husain, and I took a walk around the Cité des sciences et de l’industrie and surrounding area, and David shared some of the fascinating history behind the city.\n\n\n\nDavid Brochart, Hamel Husain, and myself pictured in front of the Philharmonie de Paris a short walk away from the JupyterCon 2023 conference hall."

Плюс: нет необходимости ловить дно Минус: возможно часть движения будет упущено.\nВ поддержку вышеизложенных предположений выступают сезонные графики за 15/30 лет следующих инструментов:\nCrude Oil (Nymex) – низкие сезонные значения января- февраля возникают из-за отсутствия спроса на основную продукцию. Отсутствие спроса в июне-августе, сменяются ростом спроса к зиме. Снижение в ноябре-декабре связано с тем, что переработчики резко сокращают закупки, чтобы избежать налога на запасы в конце года.\n\nBrent Crude Oil (IPE) – сезонные движения тесно связаны с Crude Oil Nymex\n\nNatural Gas (Nymex) – низкие сезонные значения в июле-августе. Спрос, как правило, возрастает к ноябрю месяцу, поскольку промышленность наращивает запасы для удовлетворения спроса в холодную погоду.\n\nHeating Oil (Nymex) - Потребление остается низким в течение лета. Рост спроса к ноябрю."

Впоследствии были рассмотрены более высокие моменты реверсии временного ряда: дисперсия, перекос и эксцесс. Поперечная реверсия также широко изучалась с использованием всевозможных статистик и машинного обучения; самые известные три: корреляция, коинтеграция и PCA.\nТорговые стратегии имеют множество названий в зависимости от таймфрейма и участника рынка, в том числе: статистический арбитраж, вол-арбитраж, относительная стоимость, длинная-короткая, конвергенция, пары, маркетмейкинг и т .

Например, обратите внимание на отсутствие значимых результатов при поиске в Google «импульса микроструктуры» и «финансирования импульса вариограммы».\nЭто различие пронизывает концептуальное построение, моделирование и соответствующую математику. Объяснение, связанное с микроструктурой, кажется правдоподобным: создание рынка по сути своей сводится к возвращению к среднему, поскольку в основном сводится к контролю запасов . Это контрастирует с поведенческими предубеждениями, движущими импульсом, что подтверждается многочисленными недавними доказательствами с помощью смехотворно частых пузырей на рынке.\nЭто объяснение также предполагает потенциальную вычислительную погрешность: создание рынка теперь автоматизировано, в то время как поведенческие предубеждения вызваны тем, что люди поглощают информацию с различной скоростью распространения и следуют немеханическим правилам для переключения своих распределений 401K / IRA (или, аналогично, долгосрочного портфеля взаимного фонда ).\nЭто объяснение также является статистически привлекательным, поскольку довольно просто элементарная математика может доказать, что эта комбинация приводит к нелинейным и нестационарным сигналам."

    "text": "В документе утверждается, что простой портфель «купи и держи» не приносит дохода от диверсификации. Однако обычно он имеет более низкую дисперсию, чем средневзвешенная дисперсия его составляющих. Совокупная доходность портфеля «купи и держи» определяется активами, которые работают лучше всего и, таким образом, составляют большую часть портфеля.\nС другой стороны, Вилленброк предполагает наличие премии в периодической перебалансировке некоррелированных активов.Кроме того, автор подчеркивает, что сокращение дисперсии в диверсифицированном портфеле является необходимым, но недостаточным условием получения дохода от диверсификации.\nИсследование выявило значительную премию в периодической ребалансировке криптовалют. Кроме того, в документе сравнивается ежедневно ребалансируемый портфель только для длинных позиций с портфелем для длинных и коротких позиций с различными весами короткой стороны. Кроме того, в документе анализируется способность премии за ребалансировку криптовалют улучшать показатели активов с низкой волатильностью, таких как облигации."

Например, представьте, что у вас есть два актива с нулевой доходностью и высокой волатильностью. Если мы купим только один, мы ничего не заработаем.\nОднако покупка и того, и другого и периодическая перебалансировка вынуждают инвестора покупать актив, относительная стоимость которого снизилась, и продавать актив, который вырос (таким образом, получая прибыль) в относительной стоимости (измеряемой их весами в портфеле).\nВ результате инвестор получает так называемую «премию за ребалансировку» или «доход от диверсификации»."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Согласно исследованию The Persistence of the Accruals Anomaly, фирмы с низким уровнем начислений связаны с реальной прибылью, и с другой стороны, фирмы с высоким уровнем начислений могут быть результатом некоторой бухгалтерской практики.\nВ результате акции с низким начислением должны приносить более высокую рыночную доходность, чем акции с высоким начислением.\nВпервые задокументированная Sloan (1996), аномалия начисления представляет собой отрицательную связь между бухгалтерскими начислениями и последующей доходностью акций. Теория, связанная с этой конкретной аномалией, основана на важности измерения того, основаны ли доходы компании (согласно отчету руководства компании) на реальных денежных потоках или на сомнительной практике бухгалтерского учета.\nБолее того, согласно ЛаФонду и его работе Is the Accrual Anomaly a Global Anomaly? Эта аномалия присутствует повсеместно.\nЦитируя автора: «Я исследую последствия возврата начислений в 17 странах за период с 1989 по 2003 год. В целом результаты странового анализа свидетельствуют о том, что аномалия начисления является глобальным явлением».\nСогласно исследованию, объяснением аномалии начисления является гипотеза фиксации прибыли. Гипотеза гласит, что инвесторы фиксируются на доходах и не обращают внимания отдельно на денежный поток и компоненты начисления доходов.\nСтоит отметить, что составляющая дохода, связанная с движением денежных средств, является более совершенным и лучшим средством прогнозирования будущих доходов, если мы сравним его с составляющим дохода, полученным методом начисления. Поэтому инвесторы, которые не в состоянии отличить фактическую прибыль от начислений, могут стать чрезмерно оптимистичными в отношении перспектив фирм с высокими начислениями.\nЭти результаты бросают вызов существующим теориям аномалий начисления и помогают устранить неоднозначные доказательства, показывая, что аномалия представляет собой два отдельных явления: надбавку к инвестиционным начислениям, основанную на риске, и неправильную оценку неинвестиционных начислений»."

    "text": "Одно замечательное академическое исследование показывает, что акции футбольных клубов, котирующихся на бирже, неэффективны, и этим можно воспользоваться. Инвесторы систематически переоценивают акции перед важными матчами, поскольку верят в положительный исход. Команды часто играют вничью или проигрывают, а акции приносят отрицательный доход.\nУсложненный вариант этой стратегии (не заявленный в этой версии,но теоретически осуществимый) может быть создан с использованием букмекерских контор для хеджирования операций на фондовом рынке.\nСтавки на спорт – любимое развлечение многих людей. Однако, считается что, букмекеры лучше умеют предсказывать результаты игр, чем игроки, и поэтому рынки ставок чрезвычайно эффективны. Дополнительным препятствием являются широкие спреды букмекерских контор . Это означает, что выиграть в этой игре исключительно сложно.\nВ научной статье постулируется, что важной причиной очевидной неэффективной реакции фондового рынка на результаты футбольных матчей является систематическая предвзятость в представлениях инвесторов о вероятностном распределении исходов матчей. А коэффициенты букмекерских контор составляются небольшой группой экспертов и не отражают субъективных мнений инвесторов, в отличие от цен на акции.\n\nBernile, Lyandres: Understanding Investor Sentiment: The Case of Soccer"

    "text": "Какая лучшая стратегия, когда инвестор обнаруживает пузырь? Зашортить и заработать?\nАкадемические исследования показывают, что лучше всего будет использовать избыточную прибыль, которую инвестор получает во время пузыря, и это более чем компенсирует риск последующего краха (который всегда следует).\nВажно быть рациональным и перестать пользоваться пузырем, когда он начинает лопаться, и не влюбляться в конкретную отрасль. Пузырь определяется как структурный разрыв в альфа-доходности отрасли по сравнению с общей доходностью рынка. Небольшую часть прибыли отрасли можно объяснить импульсным фактором .\nДостоверность системы кажется убедительной, поскольку исследования показывают, что отраслевые пузыри — это явление, отличное от импульса отрасли. Поскольку пузыри заканчиваются большими отрицательными аномальными доходами, их нельзя объяснить недостаточной реакцией на хорошие новости.\nОтраслевые пузыри не являются результатом неправильной спецификации моделей ценообразования активов, используемых в исследовании: пузыри нельзя объяснить упущенным фактором риска, упущенным структурным сдвигом или комбинацией факторов, поэтому торговая стратегия может использоваться как независимое дополнение к портфелю стратегий с потенциалом диверсификации."

Как можно сделать убедительную историю из работы?\n\nВ дополнение к решениям, которые были в центре нашего внимания, эксперты добровольно предложили общие области общих навыков, которые они рассматривали как важные элементы опыта в своих областях.\nОставайтесь в курсе событий в этой области, изучая соответствующие новые знания, идеи и технологии из литературы, конференций и коллег.\nРазвивайте интуицию и опыт для улучшения решения проблем.\nУлучшите навыки межличностного общения и командной работы, например, как ориентироваться в совместной работе, управлять командой и укреплять общение, особенно когда они применяютс в контексте различных процессов решения проблем.\nПовысьте свою эффективность, практикуя управление временем, включая обучение эффективному и точному выполнению определенных общих задач.\nКультивируйте отношение или мотивацию, которая включает в себя настойчивость в задаче, несмотря на препятствия, борьбу со стрессом и уверенность в решениях.\nЧтобы стать высококвалифицированным физиком, необходимо развивать эти общие навыки и учиться хорошо принимать решения.\nСамое важное и сложное требуется , чтобы студенты изучили свое собственное мышление, которое является сложным по трем причинам.\nВо-первых, иметь такой взгляд на собственное мышление просто сложно. Обсуждение идей с другими может помочь.\nВо-вторых, хороший физик, как правило, поглощен непосредственной задачей работы — например, как улучшить вакуум, как уменьшить джиттер в триггере детектора или как создать более быстрый код для оценки этого сложного интеграла. Переключить ментальные передачи, чтобы отложить эти мысли в сторону и мыслить более широко, трудно. Я нахожу полезным планировать блоки времени в моей неделе, чтобы подумать об этих рефлексивных решениях.\nТретья и, вероятно, самая серьезная трудность в принятии хороших рефлексивных решений — это предвзятость подтверждения.\nЭто устоявшаяся психологическая тенденция для людей, как только они определились с ответом, который они считают правильным, быть решительно готовыми к поддержанию этого убеждения.\nПредвзятость подтверждения заставляет их подавлять размышления об альтернативах и интерпретировать все новые доказательства таким образом, чтобы подтвердить их веру.\nЯ подозреваю, что большинство серьезных ошибок в физике были результатом такой предвзятости. Студенты (и ученые в целом) должны практиковаться в борьбе с ним при принятии рефлексивных решений."
